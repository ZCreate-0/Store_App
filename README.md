# store_app

### My second project in app development using the Flutter framework and Dart programming language has given me a basic understanding of using pre-made widgets, creating screens, navigating between them, and adding functionality. 
### I also have a basic understanding of working with rows and columns, organizing screens, and structuring the code.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
